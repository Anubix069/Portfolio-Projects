🌍 Global Temperature & CO₂ Emissions Analysis Project

📌 Description
As part of my Data Analyst Bootcamp at DataScientest, I had the opportunity to collaborate with Quentin Dusautoir, Nizar Mensi, and Jessica Renaudet on a high-impact, socially relevant project: analyzing the evolution of global temperatures and CO₂ emissions over time.

Using trusted sources like Our World in Data and NASA’s GISTEMP dataset, we aimed to better understand the correlation between human activity, fossil fuel consumption, and climate change indicators, across different continents and over several decades.

🔍 Key Insights from the Analysis
Global temperatures have increased by more than 1°C on average since the pre-industrial era, with accelerated warming since the 1970s

CO₂ emissions are highly correlated with industrial activity and energy consumption, particularly in high-income countries

A strong seasonal and regional temperature variation was identified, but long-term trends show consistent warming

Developed an interactive dashboard using Streamlit and Power BI to visualize trends and explore regional differences

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Streamlit for interactive dashboarding

Power BI for business-oriented data visualization

Jupyter Notebook for EDA and time-series analysis

💡 Skills Demonstrated
Conducting time-series analysis and building line plots, heatmaps, and correlation matrices

Designing data storytelling dashboards with real-world climate data

Merging and cleaning large datasets from multiple sources

Applying data transformation techniques using Pandas

Developing an end-to-end data pipeline: from data extraction and cleaning to insight generation and visualization

Communicating climate-related findings clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences
