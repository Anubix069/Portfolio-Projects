# 🕵️‍♂️ Web Scraping - Book Data from Books to Scrape 📚

## 📌 Description
This project uses Web Scraping to extract book information from the Books to Scrape website, a fictional site used for web scraping learning purposes. The goal is to retrieve data such as book titles, prices, ratings, and categories, and then analyze them using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The project explores techniques for data extraction, cleaning, and analysis from a website.
