# 🕵️‍♂️ Web Scraping - Book Data from Books to Scrape 📚

## 📌 Description
This project involves extracting book information from the **Books to Scrape** website, a fictional site used for web scraping learning purposes. While the live scraping functionality has been disabled in the interactive dashboard, the project still demonstrates how data was originally scraped and stored in a **CSV file** for analysis.

The goal is to retrieve data such as book titles, prices, ratings, and categories, and then analyze them using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. The project explores techniques for data extraction, cleaning, and analysis from a website.
